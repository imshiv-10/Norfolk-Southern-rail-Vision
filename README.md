# RailVision: Deep Learning for Freight Train Analysis

### Overview

Welcome to the RailVision project! This initiative, led by Siva Prasad Nidamanuri and launched on December 18, 2023, is at the forefront of applying advanced deep learning techniques to the world of freight train analysis. Our goal is to revolutionize how we identify couplers and detect defects in them, leveraging the power of AI to ensure safer and more efficient railway operations.

### What is RailVision?

RailVision is a cutting-edge project that utilizes deep learning models to analyze and interpret the complex structures of freight train couplers. By automating the detection of defects, we aim to enhance the safety standards in the rail industry and reduce the risk of accidents caused by equipment failure.

### Key Features
